## Feature list
___
- ### Feed the fish
The ultimate goal with this project is that the group wants to create and build an automated apparatus that will feed pet fish while the owner isn't at home. This will be done together with a microcontroller and a motor.
        
1. ### microcontroller
    The group will controll the fish-feeders many functions with a microcontroller called "pycom". This is the heart of this project as all our sensors and sub-components are connected to this device.
    
2. ### Stepper-motor: 
    
    The group will use a stepper motor to make the food travel from the funnel down to our dispensing mechanism. The inspiration for the dispensing mechanism is very much inspired by a meat-grinder. There is a "screw" between the water and the funnel which rotates with the help of the motor and dispenses a batch of food everytime it has rotated 180 degrees. We chose a stepper motor instead of the traditional electric motor because we want to execute a precise roll everytime so that our desired amount of food gets dispensed without the risk of it rolling over.

- ### Telemetry
The biggest factor in a group of fishies health is the water in which they live in. Factors such as PH-levels, Temperature and deapth of the water all serve as big factors for the health of the fish. The group wants to be able to see this information live.
 1. ### sensors
    The group will use a PH-sensor, Temperature sensor and proximity sensor to see all the information valuable for the user.

2. ### Display
    The group will install a display somewhere on the structure of the dispenser to give a good and visible display of the information given from the sensors.
    
3. ### RGB-Led
    The group not only wants a display to show information about the water but the group will also install a RGB-Led to show information about the dispenser itself. Red if the funnel is empty, green when its full, flashing green when activly dispensing etc.

- ### Structure
The group needs a structure holding everything together : The mechanism, the funnel and brackets for sensors and microcontroller. This will be done by first modelling it in a 3D computer enviroment called 360Fusion and later get printed by a 3D printer. 

- ### Aesthetics
The group wants to build a structure for the dispensing mechanism which is aesthetically pleasing as this will be in someones room and  clearly visible. The group will choose colours that fit the "aquarium" theme such as blue and white. The cables and sensors will also be as well hidden as possible to make the structure look neat and tidy.
