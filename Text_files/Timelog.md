## Timelog

- 12/07-21:
    * The group have written a draft for our project plan and time schedule, the group has also decided what idea to go for. We have downlaoded all software needed to start experimenting with the modelling of the 3D-prints as the group already knows it will be needed in the near future, for example Fusion360. We also made a discord group to discuss ideas and have a good form of communication.

    * The group has started modelling the first pieces needed for the integral structure of our dispenser. We ended the day by starting the 3D-printer for our first prototype. The print will take 10 hours so we will retreive it tomorrow.

- 12/09-21:
    * The first set of pieces for our first prototype are finnished and taken into observation. We noticed some small discrepincies between what we actually wanted and what the machine printed; this is why we are building a test-prototype because this will all get remodelled in 360Fusion to get a better end-result.

- 12/14-21:
    * The group had it's first meeting with the supervisor and it went well, our idea and our ambition to chase an A-grade has been approved. We are still modelling new pieces for our prototype and making sure brackets for sensors fit correctly

- 12/17-21
    * The group have done all the printing for the prototype. We will now start correcting every measurement and issue in the 3D-modelling program so that it looks neat and tidy for the finished product. The group will also think about possibly doing some minor redesigns for ergonomic and aesthetic reasons.

- 12/20-21
    * The wiring and first set of code has been finnished on the LCD-screen as well as the stepper-motor. The group has also had its second meeting with the supervisor where we showed the prototype we have printed as well as progress from the code.

    * The code for the stepper motor is completely done now and running. This will later be modified so it runs every 24 hours, it will be an easy fix when we compile everything together later.

- 12/22-21
    * The code and wireing for the ultrasonic ranging sensor is done and finnished as well as the temperature sensor, The group has also started to make progress on the IoT part of the project.

- 12/23-21
    * The group has started to develop a basic and easy-to-use app to be able to see the telemetry and controll the feeder with a button in the app. Every component to make the basic functions to make the feeder dispens food are now done and will be tested

    * The first and most crucial test will be performed from 12/23 to 12/27, the group will let the feeder run during theese dates on its own and see if food has been dispensed during the right times or not.

- 12/27-21
    * Our designated test was succesfull, the fish are alive and well and the dispenser will be kept running for further development and testing.

    * Tests have been ran on the IoT part and the group has made major advancments on the app, the group can now monitor and view all data traveling between the Pycom and PyBytes. The group has also chosen to further develop our app on the MIT app developer platform.
